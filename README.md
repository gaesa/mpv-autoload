## Improvements Over [ `autoload.lua` ](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/TOOLS/lua/autoload.lua)

`autoload.ts` is a refactored and optimized version of the original `autoload.lua` script from the mpv player. Here are some key improvements:

- **Readability and Simplicity**: The code has been restructured and simplified, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Modularity**: Unnecessary options have been removed and the code has been made more modular, enhancing its flexibility.
- **Efficiency**: Complex nested loops and lengthy functions have been eliminated, resulting in a more efficient script.
- **Simplified Logic**: The main logic of the script has been simplified, making it more straightforward and easier to follow.

With these improvements, `autoload.ts` provides a cleaner, more efficient, and ready to use approach to automatically loading video and audio files into the mpv playerâ€™s playlist.
